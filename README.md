<h1>Where 2 Meet</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The Where 2 Meet app allows a person to easily schedule a meeting with friends and family. It provides a way for everyone to discuss the meeting date, time, location, and the meeting activities. This will be done by creating a meeting request that can be sent out to people as a message and allow people to respond with a vote of YES to attend or NO to not attend, plus they can add comments to their response. Everyone that receives the request, will see these responses. If the meeting event needs to be changed, the person that created the meeting request can modify the event and send it back out. After all the details have been decided, the app will allow a calendar event to be generated that will send out notifications to remind everyone about the meeting event.
